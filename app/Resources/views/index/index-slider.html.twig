                                services. Suddenly there came running up one who told him that his house had been broken

                                Every man carries Two Bags about with him, one in front and one behind, and both are
                                packed full of faults. The Bag in front contains his neighbours’ faults, the one behind
                                his own. Hence it is that men do not see their own faults, but never fail to see
                                those of others.
